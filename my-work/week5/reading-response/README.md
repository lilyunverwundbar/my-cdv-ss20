##### *Think of contemporary systems/applications in which data is used to predict the future in order to then act upon it. Compile a list of 3 such situations that come to your mind and describe them briefly.*
- The “Skynet” (天网) is the massive surveillance network in China, which claims to be a part of the policing system for criminal tracking only. The system analyzes tons of footages from different cameras to draw connections of individual traces, with the help of high computational power and big data aided with computer vision. It has been reported that the system would spot “potential criminals” in the crowd judging by their appearance based on previous data to prevent future crimes.
- The insurance industry utilizes health data to grasp a general idea of their client’s future conditions. The client, if identified “risky” from the company’s perspective, would be limited on purchasing relevant products, such as life insurance and critical illness insurance.
- Similar to the previous application, there are companies offering DNA test which claims to decode people’s genetic informations, such as potential risks of diseases and biological insights. Knowing genetic imperfections will affect people psychologically to make different choices in life. 


##### *Collect your thoughts on the Prediction and its role in the three above sources. Your associations, opinions and ideas may be complemented by reflections on "collective average vs individual fate", "statistic vs. algorithmic prediction" or "social physics" (but don't feel obliged to discuss these). Express yourself in 300-400 words.*
The above cases are respectively a governmental policy, a widely adopted commercial methodology, and an optional service which people can participate voluntarily, each of which is less mandatory than the former.

The "Skynet" tracking system works effectively in investigation on existing crimes - the sythesized surveilance infrastructure can trace and locate a suspect solely based on a reference portrait. Besides the debate on privacy violation, the data-driven approach introduces bias as well - "Skynet" would suggest more policing attention on certain communities and even people who has similar looks to the suspects. And yet the strategy has been practiced without technical help anyways, justifying the system with bias as a powerful invesigation tool. Although the Skynet does not dictate forensic evidence and judicial decisions, like in *Minority Reports* , relying too much on it would inevitably blind the police from seeing an alternative narrative, where justice could have been better done. 

We all agree that insurance companies are not charities and adopting any profitable means sounds intuitively fine, unless the capitalist system is wrong.  WIth more and more precise data-driven commercial risk assessment, people in desperate need for help can be accidentally excluded, causing tragedies and instabilities in the end on a societal scale.

I always think commercial DNA tests as a fun perspective to look at myself - I pay to know myself better according my own weight of trust in the technology. If it is not enforced by a higher authority, it is another story.

People grow up and live without recognizing the pattern of life among the species, but our society now do, with or without significance, for better or worse. Debating whether statistics give better insights and to what extend we should believe and react upon that is indeed debating who we are as human. Do we consider ourselves as unique individuals or a sheer component of a societal machine, which we built ourselves, presumably for a better life?
