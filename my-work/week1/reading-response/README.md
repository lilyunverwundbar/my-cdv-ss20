### Reading Response - Week 1
To [Critical Questions for Big Data](https://github.com/leoneckert/critical-data-and-visualization-spring-2020/blob/master/readings/boyd_crawford_2012.pdf) by danah boyd and Kate Crawford (2012).

* #### Introduction and Chapter 2
  ##### *Why does Bowker say "''Raw data is both an oxymoron and a bad idea"? (pp.663)*  
    No data is truly raw, if harshly judged. The data claimed to be the rawest would still fail to confront questions in subjective factors, such as the sample of choice, the selected properties of focus, the methodology applied, and the type of instruments to collect the data - there must be some decisions made before the data collection and inevitably involves the subjectivity. The wide adoption of the term "raw data" could be misleading to our mind so that the data seems somewhat unquestionable while disguising potential flaws.

* #### Section 1 (pp. 665)
    ##### *What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"?*  
    The novel tool invented to measure enables different ways of analysis and therefore contributes to new decision-making mechanisms. That is, new ways of seeing will eventually result in new ways of interacting,  making not only the previous knowledge, but also the previous system of knowledge obsolete. 

* #### Section 3 and 4 (pp. 668)
    ##### *In which way is Twitter data limited?*  
    The owners of each thread of online data (tweets) and the intended sample of population do not form a one-to-one correspondence, which is overlooked in many research processes thus producing inaccuracy. Besides, the entry of Twitter data (public APIs) and the vast corpus on the platform are both unexamined in its objectivity. The former lacks transparency in equal accessibility to the complete database, while the latter inevitably suffer from censorship to sensitive content. Furthermore, the mass quantitive data pull the subjects out from context that could be hard to reinterpret. That is, the tie strength of proposed connections is challenged by the abundant yet flat information.
    
* #### Section 5 (pp.671)
    ##### *If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.*   
    In my opinion, online data with public visability are public to a variety of uses, somewhat including being analyzed if thinking of social media as a commercial service instead of charity. Surely, the asymmetrical power dynamic between users and researches is a tricky issue. However, to some extend, users are giving up the control over their speach for better social publicity online at the moment they decide to sign up on the company owned platform. Probably fewer people would doubt whether the data analysts inside Twitter Inc. are at a better position to conduct data mining. Being equally ethically troublesome in both scholarly and business use cases, the latter has even stronger motive to further exploit user data, mostly unnoticeable without publication. The corporation may have better procedural ethics while the seemingly innocent academic usage with transparent publication may result in worse scenarios for individual users. In short, the usage of public data is a debatable question covering numerous topics - data privacy, social media as a field of speach and also a commercial service, and scholarly and business ethics.
    

* #### Section 6
    > We should consider how the tools participate in shaping the world with us as we use them.

    Well Said.
