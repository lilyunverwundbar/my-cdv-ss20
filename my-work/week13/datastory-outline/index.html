                    Digital cameras uses electronic image sensors to capture light. Therefore, the technology behind the
                    <b>image sensor</b> is crucial for better image quality.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past decades, digital cameras benefit from advanced electronic manufacturing. As
                    semiconductors get smaller, more pixels can be packed into a single sensor, resulting in a sharper
                    and clearer image.

                    Sensor Form Factor

                <p>
                    A <b>Full-Frame</b> digital camera is one with an image sensor format that
                    is the same size as <b>35 mm format film</b>.
                    <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/6GUAAOSwMilciT0T/s-l1600.jpg" width='200px'>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, 35 mm was considered a small
                    film format compared with medium format, large format and even larger. However, due to high defect
                    rate of larger digital image sensor, <b>smaller form factors</b> are much more commonly seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If under the same glass, smaller sensors cover a <b>smaller field of view</b> and thus a
                    <b>magnified perspective</b>.

                    Type of Lens System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without doubt, more sphisticated cameras with <span style='color:#1C415A'><b>Interchangeable Lens
                            System</b></span> takes a relatively professional approach, therefore, equipped with larger
                    sensors for quality lens families.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Manufacturers prefer small sensors for cameras with a <span style='color:#ED6168'><b>Built-In Lens
                            System</b></span>. Besides cost saving in the low-end market, the optical system is also a
                    consideration. Since smaller sensors crop out the edges and enlarge the center of the frame, the
                    zoom range of a lens expands as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, a light-weight zoom lens (4-20mm) on a <b>1-inch</b> sensor could covers the same range
                    of a
                    heavy zoom (24-120mm) on a <b>Full-Frame</b> sensor.

                    Generally, digital cameras get lighter as time goes. Althogh the most high-end camera of the day are

                    Since the mid-90s, digital cameras have been around as a type of consumer electronics. During the
                    almost two decades, we have witnessed an interplay between technologies, business competitions,
                    product designs, and our changing lifestyles, especially in the ongoing revolution of mobile
                    photography.
